# General

## <span id="What_is_Wortheum_news">What is wortheum.news?</span>

Wortheum has redefined jornlism by building a living, breathing, and growing media economy - a community where users are rewarded for sharing their voice. It's a new kind of attention economy.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="How_does_Wortheum_work">How does Wortheum work?</span>

Wortheum.news is a web3 news website that are powered by the Wortheum blockchain and WORTH cryptocurrency. All of these websites read and write content to the Wortheum blockchain, which stores the content in an immutable blockchain ledger, and rewards users for their contributions with digital tokens called WORTH.

Every day, the Wortheum blockchain mints new WORTH tokens and adds them to a community's "rewards pool". These tokens are then awarded to users for their contributions, based on the votes that their content receives. Users who hold more tokens in their account as "Worth Power" will get to decide where a larger portion of the rewards pool is distributed.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="How_does_Wortheum_differ_from_other_news_websites">How does Wortheum differ from other news websites?</span>

While most news websites/platforms extract this value for the benefit of their shareholders, Wortheum believes that the users of the platform should receive the benefits and rewards for their attention and the contributions they make to the platform.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="What_do_I_need_to_do_in_order_to_secure_my_account">What do I need to do in order to secure my account?</span>

Unlike most other websites, **there is no way to recover your account if you lose your password / owner key!** This is why it is extremely important that you save and backup your password somewhere safe. It is strongly recommended that you store an offline copy in case of a hard drive failure or other calamity. Consider digital offline storage, such as an external disk or flash drive, as well as printed paper stored in a fireproof safe. Use a safe deposit box for best redundancy.

If you leak your private key to another user or a third-party website, that user or website will have full access to your account. This means they can steal it, as well as the funds inside of it. It is therefore not recommended to enter your private key information with any other user or third-party website. If you believe your account has been compromised, you should change your password/keys right away.

Each account has multiple keys, which each have different levels of authority: owner, active, posting, and memo. The information on the different types of keys and their purposes, as well as more information on password and key security, can be found in the section on <a href="#Table_of_Contents_Security">Security</a>.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="Does_it_cost_anything_to_post__comment__or_vote">Does it cost anything to post, comment, or vote?</span>

No. It is free to post, comment, and vote on content on wortheum.news. You might even get paid for it!

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="Can_I_earn_digital_tokens_on_Wortheum_How">Can I earn digital tokens on Wortheum? How?</span>

You can earn digital tokens on Wortheum by:

**Posting** - By sharing your posts, you can earn upvotes from community members. Depending on the upvotes you receive, you may get a portion of the "rewards pool".

**Voting and curating** - If you discover a post and upvote it before it becomes popular, you can earn a curation reward. The reward amount will depend on the amount of Worth Power you have.

**Purchasing** - Users can purchase Worth or Worth Dollar tokens directly through their Wortheum wallet using bitcoin, Ether, or BNB tokens.
**Vesting** - WORTH tokens that are powered up to Worth Power will earn a small amount of new tokens for holding.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="Where_do_the_tokens_come_from">Where do the tokens come from?</span>

The Wortheum network continually creates new digital tokens to reward content creators and curators. Some of the newly-created tokens are transferred to users who add value to Wortheum by posting, commenting, and voting on other people's posts. The remainder is distributed to holders of Worth Power and the witnesses that power the blockchain.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="Where_does_the_value_come_from">Where does the value come from?</span>

At its root, Worth is simply a points system. However, because this points system is blockchain-based, the points can be traded on markets as tokens. People buy and sell these tokens, and many hold in anticipation of increased purchasing power for various Wortheum-related services.

By analogy, Wortheum is a game system where users compete for attention and rewards by bringing content and adding value to the platform. The rewards people earn are tokens that have market value and are readily tradable. It is similar to how someone playing a video game could obtain a limited item or currency by playing the game. If the currency or items are transferable between users, then they can sell or buy them on game item markets.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="Why_are_people_getting_vastly_different_rewards">Why are people getting vastly different rewards?</span>

Wortheum is not a "get rich quick" scheme. While it is possible to post content that goes viral quickly and earn a lot of rewards on a single post, this is not typical for most users.

Most of the authors that you see earning high rewards are users that have spent a lot of time in the network building followings, making connections with others, and developing a reputation for bringing high quality content.

It is best to have realistic expectations, without focusing on rewards when you are first starting out. Work on building a following, making connections, and developing a good reputation. Consistency will pay off in the long run.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="Is_there_a_desktop_wallet_available_for_WORTH">Is there a desktop wallet available for WORTH?</span>

No. Not yet. So you can use official web wallet untill desktop and smartphone application we release.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Accounts">^</a>
## <span id="Can_I_speed_up_the_account_approval_process">Can I speed up the account approval process?</span>

There is currently no way to speed up the account approval process. If you are unable to wait, there are third-party websites listed below that allow you to bypass the approval process and pay to open an account.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Accounts">^</a>
## <span id="Why_do_I_need_to_provide_my_email_and_phone_number">Why do I need to provide my email and phone number?</span>

To create an account on the blockchain, it costs WORTH tokens. When you create an account through Wortheum.news, Wortheum team is supplying the tokens to pay the account creation fee. In order to prevent users from abusing the paid-for signup and creating multiple accounts, we need to be able to verify that each user is only signing up for one account.

## <span id="Can_I_create_a_Wortheum_account_without_an_email_and_phone_number">Can I create a Wortheum account without an email and phone number?</span>

The only way to have an account created via Wortheum.news is to supply your email and phone number. Because Wortheum is an open and permissionless network, there are other ways to create an account. Any Wortheum blockchain account can be used on wortheum.news.

## <span id="What_are_other_ways_to_create_an_account_on_the_blockchain_besides_using_Wortheum_news">What are other ways to create an account on the blockchain besides using Wortheum.news?</span>

If you are willing to pay your own signup fee, then there are other ways to create a new account on the blockchain.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Accounts">^</a>
## <span id="What_happens_if_my_email_or_phone_number_changes">What happens if my email or phone number changes?</span>

Currently there is no way to change the email or phone number that is linked to your account.  Though once your account is created, you can continue to use it even if the email or phone number that is linked to the account has changed.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Accounts">^</a>
## <span id="Am_I_allowed_to_create_more_than_one_account">Am I allowed to create more than one account?</span>

## <span id="Am_I_required_to_verify_my_identity">Am I required to verify my identity?</span>

Verification is a process where users give evidence to show that they are the person that they claim to be.  This is to reduce fraud and people impersonating known figures. If you would like to remain anonymous, that is perfectly fine. However if you claim to be someone specific, the community may expect that you verify you are who you say you are.

There are a number of ways to do this. The most common way to verify your identity is by posting a link to your Wortheum profile on a website or social media account which you are already known for having such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, a blog, or photography site.

Many users also like to post a photo or a video which shows them holding up a sheet of paper with the current date and their Wortheum account name handwritten on it. This is a great way to add a personal touch to verifying.

## <span id="What_are_tags">What are tags?</span>

Tags are a way to categorize your content, so that others can find it. The more relevant the tags are to the post, the more like-minded people will come across it.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Posting">^</a>
## <span id="What_tags_should_I_use">What tags should I use?</span>

Try to use tags that are relevant to your news, and that will be popular for other people to browse. For example, "mytriptoalaska" may be relevant to your post, but readers are probably not going to go searching for that. Using "travel" would be a better choice for a tag in this case.

You can browse through commonly used tags using the "Explore" link, in the main menu.

Be mindful when choosing tags. If your tags aren’t related to your post, your post may get downvotes for mistagging.

All tags must be lowercase letters. Spaces aren't allowed, but hyphenated words with a single dash are.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Posting">^</a>
## <span id="How_many_tags_can_I_use">How many tags can I use?</span>

## <span id="What_does__Promoting__a_post_do">What does "Promoting" a post do?</span>

When you make a post, there is the option to promote it with Worth Dollars. It will then show up in the “Promoted” tab. The order that it appears in the list depends on how much the post was promoted for. Posts with a higher promoted amount will be higher than posts with less.

Worth Dollars spent to promote a post are paid to the account @null, which nobody owns or controls. Once a user transfers SBD to @null, the Wortheum blockchain removes them from the currency supply.

You can promote your own posts, or posts that you like from other users.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Posting">^</a>
## <span id="How_do_I_promote_a_post">How do I promote a post?</span>

## <span id="Where_do_the_new_WORTH_tokens_come_from">Where do the new WORTH tokens come from?</span>

Blockchains like Wortheum and Bitcoin produce new tokens each time a block is produced. Unlike Bitcoin, where all of the new coins go to the block producers (called miners), the Wortheum blockchain allocates a majority of the new tokens to a reward fund called the "rewards pool". The rewards pool gives users tokens for participating in the platform based on the value they add.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="How_many_new_tokens_are_generated_by_the_blockchain">How many new tokens are generated by the blockchain?</span>

Starting with the network's 1st hard fork, Wortheum began creating new tokens at a yearly inflation rate of 9.5%. The inflation rate decreases at a rate of 0.01% every 250,000 blocks, or about 0.5% per year. The inflation will continue decreasing at this pace until the overall inflation rate reaches 0.95%. This will take about 20.5 years from the time hard fork 1 went into effect.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="How_are_the_new_tokens_distributed">How are the new tokens distributed?</span>

Out of the new tokens that are generated:
- 65% go to the reward pool, which is split between authors (50%) and curators (50%).
- 15% of the new tokens are awarded to holders of Worth Power.
- 10% of the new tokens are being used to generate WBD for the WPS (@worth.dao)
- The remaining 10% pays for the witnesses to power the blockchain.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="Which_exchanges_are_WORTH_and_WBD_listed_on">Which exchanges are WORTH and WBD listed on?</span>

WORTH and WBD are not listed on any exchanges.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="What_is_the_reward_pool">What is the reward pool?</span>

Every day, a fixed amount of WORTH tokens are allocated to the network reward fund, commonly called the "reward pool." These get distributed to authors and curators for posting and voting on content.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="How_is_the_reward_pool_split_between_authors_and_curators">How is the reward pool split between authors and curators?</span>

Up to 50% of a post's payout is awarded to curators (the people who upvoted the post) as a reward for discovering the content. The other 50% is awarded to the author.

If curators vote for a post within the first 5 minutes of it being created, a portion of their curation reward is going back to the reward pool. This portion is linear to the age of the post between 0 and 5 minutes. As an example: upvoting at 15 minutes will donate half of your potential curation reward back to the reward pool.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="Will_the_reward_pool_pay_out_more_or_less_depending_on_who_votes">Will the reward pool pay out more or less depending on who votes?</span>

There is a fixed amount of WORTH coins that gets added to the rewards pool each day. In the short term, the amount of coins that get paid out may be higher or lower depending on the amount of voting activity, but over time it will pay out the full amount of rewards regardless of who votes.

Votes in Wortheum are stake-weighted. Therefore voters with more Worth Power have a greater influence over the allocation than voters with less WP, but their votes do not increase the amount of rewards in the rewards pool.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="Why_do_the_earnings_for_my_post_go_up_or_down">Why do the earnings for my post go up or down?</span>

The amount that is shown next to a post is a "**Potential Payout**". This is an estimated value of how much money the post will make based on the votes that have occurred so far. Depending on various factors, this value can go up or down until the payout window closes:

- If a post receives more upvotes, the potential payout of the post can go up.
- If a post receives more downvotes, the potential payout of the post can go down.
- If other posts receive more upvotes, the potential payout of the post can go down.
- If other posts receive more downvotes, the potential payout of the post can go up.
- If upvotes are removed from a post, the potential payout of the post can go down.
- If downvotes are removed from a post, the potential payout of the post can go up.
- If the price of WORTH goes up, the potential payout of all posts can go up.
- If the price of WORTH goes down, the potential payout of all posts can go down.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="When_can_I_claim_my_rewards">When can I claim my rewards?</span>

Posts and comments remain active for 7 days. When the period is over, you are able to claim their earned rewards. In your Wallet, click the Claim Rewards button to add the tokens to your account.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="What_is_the_difference_between_WORTH__WORTH_Power__and_Worth_Dollars">What is the difference between WORTH, Worth Power, and Worth Dollars?</span>

**WORTH** - WORTH is the base liquid currency token in the platform. WORTH can be powered up into Worth Power, traded for Worth Dollars, or transferred to other accounts. It is a cryptocurrency token, similar to bitcoin.

**Worth Power** - Worth Power (abbreviated WP) is a measurement of how much influence a user has in the Wortheum network. The more Wortheum Power a user holds, the more they can influence the value of posts and comments. Worth Power is less liquid. If a user wishes to “Power Down” WP, they will receive equal distributions of the WORTH weekly, over a 13 week period.

**Worth Dollars** - Worth Dollars (commonly abbreviated WBD) are liquid stable-value currency tokens designed to be pegged to $1 USD. Worth Dollars can be traded with WORTH, and transferred to other accounts for commerce or exchange.  Worth Dollars may also be converted into WORTH via a process that takes 3.5 days. 

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="What_is_delegated_WORTH_Power">What is delegated Worth Power?</span>

Users have the option to delegate Worth Power to other users. When a user is delegated Worth Power - their bandwidth, content votes, and curation rewards are calculated as if it were their own Worth Power. Users are not able to power down or cash out delegated Worth Power however, as it still belongs to the original owner.

Most users will have a small amount of Worth Power delegated to them by the Wortheum account after creating an account via wortheum.news.

Delegated Worth Power shows up in a user's wallet below their actual Worth Power balance in parentheses.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="What_determines_the_price_of_WORTH">What determines the price of WORTH?</span>

The price of WORTH is based on the supply and demand of the token, as determined by buyers and sellers on the exchanges. It is similar to how the price of a commodity like gold is determined.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="How_do_I_get_more_WORTH_Power">How do I get more Worth Power?</span>

With WORTH tokens in your wallet, click "Power Up" to turn them into Worth Power. If you have Worth Dollars, you can convert them to WORTH from your wallet, and then power up the WORTH.

If you don’t already have WORTH or Worth Dollars in your wallet, you can purchase them using bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), or BitShares (BTS) tokens. You may purchase BTC on various exchanges, such as Coinbase.com or Localbitcoins.com.

To buy:
- Click "Buy Worth" from the main menu in the top right corner of wortheum.news, or from your wallet.
- Select the currency to deposit, and enter the amount of that currency you wish to use.
- Enter your wortheum account name (without the @) for "Your receive address".
- Click the "Get Deposit Address" button.
- Send the currency to the provided address.

## <span id="How_long_does_it_take_WORTH_or_WORTH_Power_that_I_purchased_to_show_up_in_my_account">How long does it take WORTH or Worth Power that I purchased to show up in my account?</span>

Transactions on the Wortheum blockchain typically only take about three seconds to process, but when you are purchasing the Worth tokens using bitcoin or some other token, then the transaction must wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the other network. This can take several hours, and sometimes even days.    

If you paid using bitcoin, the third party website <a href="https://bitcoinfees.21.co/">bitcoinfees.21.co</a> can estimate the approximate wait time of the transaction based on the fees that were paid. The third party website <a href="https://blockchain.info/">blockchain.info</a> will lookup the fees that were paid on a specific blockchain transaction.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="What_is_powering_up_and_down">What is powering up and down?</span>

**Powering up** - If you have WORTH tokens, you can Power Up to Worth Power to get more voting influence on posts and comments. Having more Worth Power also increases the amount of curation rewards and new vested tokens that you can earn. More WP also grants more influence on approving Wortheum witnesses.

**Powering down** - If you have Worth Power, you can power down to turn it into liquid WORTH over a period of time. The system will transfer 1/13 of your Worth Power to WORTH each week for about three months (13 weeks), starting 1 week from the time it is started. However, you will lose your influence in the network proportionally to how much is powered down, so think about it carefully. Power downs can be stopped at any time.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="What_do_the_dollar_amounts_for_pending_payouts_represent">What do the dollar amounts for pending payouts represent?</span>

The dollar amounts next to posts and comments are estimates of the potential payout that will occur when the payout period ends, based on the current voting activity and price of WORTH. These potential payout amounts may fluctuate up or down until the payout period ends.

Payouts occur as a combination of Worth Power and Worth Dollars. Sometimes the blockchain may substitute WORTH in place of the Worth Dollars based on market conditions.

The blockchain estimates the dollar value of WORTH and Worth Power based on the 3.5 day average price of WORTH reported by the witnesses. The blockchain assumes Worth Dollars are worth approximately one USD.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="Will_1_Worth_Dollar_always_be_worth__1_00_USD">Will 1 Worth Dollar always be worth $1.00 USD?</span>

The market value of a Worth Dollar is dictated by the supply and demand of the token. Therefore it is possible for 1 WBD to be worth more or less than 1 USD depending on market conditions.

If you convert Worth Dollars to WORTH, the blockchain will process the transaction over a period of 3.5 days. At the end of the 3.5 days, the WBD will be gone and replaced by approximately $1 USD worth of WORTH tokens. The "approximately 1 USD worth of WORTH tokens" is based on the median WORTH price over the 3.5 days, using the price feeds from the Wortheum witnesses. Depending on price fluctuations during the 3.5 days it is possible to end up with more or less than $1 USD worth of WORTH per WBD at the end of the conversion. This is an advanced user feature, and is currently only available to users using external wallets.

## <span id="Can_I_sell_goods_and_services_on_Wortheum">Can I sell goods and services on Wortheum?</span>

Other than making a post and making sales manually, there is no interface for selling items directly on wortheum.news. You can list goods and services on the third-party websites and accept payment in Worth Dollars or WORTH. You also have the option to advertise your items through Wortheum posts.

## <span id="How_can_I_withdraw_my_WORTH_or_WBD_coins">How can I withdraw my WORTH or WBD coins?</span>

WORTH and WBD tokens are readily tradable to bitcoin, which can be traded for the local currency of your choice. There is a link to "Sell" your WORTH and WBD tokens in your wallet.

It is recommended that you withdraw a small amount first, to verify it works before withdrawing a larger amount.

## <span id="Will_I_get_a_1099_from_Wortheum">Will I get a 1099 from Wortheum?</span>

No, you are not being paid by Wortheum. The Wortheum network rewards you. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions you make. Further, it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. By creating an account, you agree that Wortheum OU. is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Worth transactions, or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any Worth transactions.

# Voting and Curating

## <span id="What_is_my_voting_power">What is my voting power?</span>

Voting power is like an "energy bar" in a computer game that goes down a little bit every time you vote. You start out with 100% voting power. Every time you vote, you will use a small amount of your voting power.

As you use more of your voting power, your votes will carry less influence. A vote with 50% voting power left will be worth 1/2 as much as a vote cast with 100% voting power. Not to worry, the network recharges your voting power by 20% every day.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Voting_and_Curating">^</a>
## <span id="How_many_times_can_I_vote_without_depleting_my_voting_power">How many times can I vote without depleting my voting power?</span>

Every 100% vote you cast will use 2% of your remaining voting power. Your voting power will recharge by 20% each day. You can vote more than 10 times per day, but each vote will be worth less, and it will take longer to reach full voting power again.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Voting_and_Curating">^</a>
## <span id="Can_I_vote_with_less_than_100__of_my_voting_strength">Can I vote with less than 100% of my voting strength?</span>

New users can only upvote and downvote with 100% voting strength.

Once you reach about 500 Worth Power, you will see a vote slider appear when you vote. You can use the slider to adjust the weight of your vote, between 1% and 100% voting strength. Voting with less than 100% voting weight will use up less voting power, but it will also have less of an influence on the post or comment's rewards.

<img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmV6c21tzSrgXwPHx4tvuc1UiCXBEvzkLBH9QCZHtVN6Ma/image.png">

Upvotes and downvotes use the same amount of voting power.

## <span id="What_determines_how_much_of_the_curation_reward_goes_to_the_author_versus_curators">What determines how much of the curation reward goes to the author versus curators?</span>

The rewards are allocated so that 50% of the payout goes to the author of the post/comment, and 50% goes to the curator.

Of the 50% that goes to the curator, that portion will be split between going back to the reward pool and the curator if the curator votes within the first 5 minutes. The split of the 50% during the first 5 minutes is calculated linearly based on the time the vote is cast.

- If a post is upvoted the moment of posting, 100% of the curation reward goes back to the reward pool.
- At 0.5 minutes, 10% goes to the curator and 90% goes back.
- At 2.5 minutes it's a 50/50 split.
- At 4.5 minutes, 90% goes to the curator and 10% goes back.
- If a post is upvoted 5 min after posting, 100% of the curation reward goes to the curator.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Voting_and_Curating">^</a>
## <span id="Can_I_get_curation_rewards_for_upvoting_comments">Can I get curation rewards for upvoting comments?</span>

Yes. You can earn curation rewards from upvoting both posts and comments!

## <span id="Do_I_get_curation_rewards_for_downvoting_posts_or_comments">Do I get curation rewards for downvoting posts or comments?</span>

No. Since downvoting reduces the rewards on a post/comment, it does not earn curation rewards.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Voting_and_Curating">^</a>
## <span id="Why_don_t_my_upvotes_have_an_effect_on_a_post_s_rewards">Why don't my upvotes have an effect on a post's rewards?</span>

A user with more WP is going to have a larger influence on the rewards than users with less WP. One vote from a user with a lot of WP can often have more of an effect than 100 votes from users with a small amount of WP.

Even though your vote may not have an immediate effect, when it gets added in along with all the other votes at the end of the payout period, it can still affect the payout. It may also cause more users to vote on the post too, because they saw that you upvoted it - so your votes can have an indirect effect on the payout this way.

## <span id="Is_there_a_way_to_make_my_votes_count_for_more">Is there a way to make my votes count for more?</span>

Yes. The more Worth Power you have, the more influence your votes will have.

The platform does not require that anybody purchase WP in order to participate, and there are many users who have earned a lot of Worth Power without spending any of their own money. You have the option of purchasing more Worth Power through your Wortheum wallet.

## <span id="What_are_the_valid_reasons_for_downvoting">What are the valid reasons for downvoting?</span>

Users are allowed to downvote for any reason that they want. There are many users in the community who recommend only using the downvote on posts that are abusive. It is up to you if you want to follow this etiquette.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Voting_and_Curating">^</a>
## <span id="Does_a_downvote_mean_that_I_did_something_wrong">Does a downvote mean that I did something wrong?</span>

Just because you received a downvote does not mean that you did something wrong. The downvoting person may have just been voting to reallocate the rewards in a way that they felt was more beneficial to the other active posts in the platform. Often users will leave a comment explaining why they downvoted, but sometimes they might not. If they left a reason, it is up to you to determine if you did anything wrong, and if there is anything you want to change.

# Plagiarism, Spam, and Abuse

## <span id="What_is_considered_spam_or_abuse">What is considered spam or abuse?</span>

- Asking for money, views, upvotes, follows, or resteems.
- Leaving nearly identical or materially similar comments on multiple posts.
- Comments that are unrelated to the topic of discussion.
- Sending unsolicited links or requests to users via wallet memos.
- Posts that require upvotes to enter or play in a contest or game.
- Sending users a link to your blog or a post if it is not relevant to the conversation.
- Posts or comments that include little or nothing more than an offer to trade follows or upvotes.
- Using tags that are unrelated to the post.
- Threatening users with any type of physical violence.
- Not citing sources when using someone else’s material.
- Posting ‘not safe for work’ content without using the “nsfw” tag.

# Reputation

## <span id="What_is_Reputation">What is Reputation?</span>

Every user has a reputation score next to their name. The reputation score is one way Wortheum measures the amount of value you have brought to the community. It is also a mechanism that is designed to help reduce abuse of the Wortheum platform.

Your reputation goes up when accounts vote on your content. Getting downvoted by someone with a higher reputation can push your reputation down and make your posts less visible.

Users with a lower reputation score are unable to affect your reputation.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Reputation">^</a>
## <span id="How_is_the_Reputation_score_measured">How is the Reputation score measured?</span>

Every new user starts off with a reputation score of 25.

The reputation score is based off of a `log10` system, which means that a score of 40 is about 10x better than a score of 30.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Reputation">^</a>
## <span id="How_do_I_improve_my_reputation_score">How do I improve my reputation score?</span>

Every time another user upvotes one of your posts or comments, it increases your reputation score. The more Worth Power that the voter has, the larger the effect is. The best way to earn upvotes is by adding value to the Wortheum community.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Reputation">^</a>
## <span id="What_causes_my_reputation_score_to_go_down">What causes my reputation score to go down?</span>

The only way for your reputation score to go down is to be downvoted by another user. Not all downvotes will cause a reputation loss though.

- Downvotes from users with a lower reputation score than you will not hurt your score.
- If your post or comment that was downvoted still received more upvotes than downvotes (weighted by WP), then the net effect on your reputation score will still be positive.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Reputation">^</a>
## <span id="Why_does_my_reputation_score_matter">Why does my reputation score matter?</span>

A reputation score is one way Wortheum measures the amount of value you have brought to the community. In real estate, they say there are three variables of the utmost importance: location, location, location. On Wortheum, those things are: reputation, reputation, reputation. It’s not to say other variables aren’t important, but reputation will be an enormous factor in your level of success.

Many Wortheum users glance at users’ reputation scores when deciding which articles to read because they know higher reputation scores means it is much more likely quality content. Furthermore, the higher your rep, the more effect your vote will have on the reputation of others.

It is worth noting that if your reputation score goes below 0, Wortheum will hide your posts and comments making it very difficult to gain monetary rewards and followers. This incentivizes online etiquette and respect for your fellow users.

# Followers, Feeds, and Resteem

## <span id="What_is_Resteeming">What is Resteeming?</span>

This is like reblogging or sharing posts on other platforms.  Once you resteem a post it will appear in your feed and in your followers' feeds as if you had posted it yourself.  Use it conservatively and with caution.  It is great to want to share content you like and appreciate with people you follow, but you don't want to overwhelm your followers either.

# Blockchain

## <span id="What_is_a_blockchain">What is a blockchain?</span>

A blockchain is a public ledger of all transactions ever executed. All of the transactions and data are stored in a distributed database. Each time the database is updated, all of updates are done together in a batch called a 'block'. Each time a new block is produced/added, it is appended on to all of the previous blocks - hence the name "blockchain".

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Blockchain">^</a>
## <span id="What_is_the_Wortheum_blockchain">What is the Wortheum blockchain?</span>

The Wortheum blockchain is the publicly accessible distributed database, which records all posts and votes, and distributes the rewards across the network. It is where all of the text content and voting data is stored, and it is where all of the reward calculations and payouts are performed.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Blockchain">^</a>
## <span id="How_does_bandwidth_work_on_the_Wortheum_blockchain">How does bandwidth work on the Wortheum blockchain?</span>

Since transacting on the Wortheum blockchain has zero fees, bandwidth rate-limiting is employed to safeguard the blockchain from spam attacks. Everything action that you take on the blockchain will consume a small amount of bandwidth. This includes posting, commenting, voting, transferring tokens, etc. Viewing content does not consume bandwidth.

Every user has a limited amount of bandwidth to use each week. The more transactions a user does, the less bandwidth they will have left (until it recharges). Users with more Worth Power will have a higher bandwidth allowance.

Normally everyone's bandwidth allowance is quite high, and users are able to use the network freely without any interruptions. Sometimes when the blockchain becomes busy however (due to heavy use), everyone's individual allowances may go down until the network becomes less busy.


If users are below their bandwidth limit, they will be unable to transact with the blockchain until their bandwidth recharges or their limit is raised.

If you get an error that you have exceeded your bandwidth allowance, it is normally best to just wait and try again later (when it is less busy). Usually if you wait and try again later, the transaction will likley go through.

If you are unable to transact for extended periods of time, or you are frequently running into bandwidth limits, then you will either need to reduce your usage to stay within your limit.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Blockchain">^</a>
## <span id="What_is_the_difference_between_Worth_and_Wortheum">What is the difference between Worth and Wortheum?</span>

Wortheum is the name of the blockchain that stores all of the data and transactions, and processes all of the events that take place. WORTH is also a name for the system’s value token (currency).

Wortheum is a front end web interface to interact with the blockchain, and view the blockchain data. Wortheum OU. is also the name of the company that owns and operates the website wortheum.news.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Blockchain">^</a>
## <span id="How_is_Worth_different_from_Bitcoin">How is Worth different from Bitcoin?</span>

On a technical level, the two networks rely on the same model of a blockchain, but are built upon different technologies and codebase. Wortheum is based on a new state-of-the-art blockchain technology called Graphene, which uses "witnesses" instead of "miners" to produce blocks.

The "delegated proof of stake" model of using witnesses instead of miners allows for greater efficiency in block production. With BTC, 100% of the new coins that are created are allocated to block producers (miners). With the Worth blockchain, only 10% of the new coins are paid to block producers (witnesses). The other 90% of new WORTH coins are awarded to content producers, curators, and Worth Power holders.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Blockchain">^</a>
## <span id="What_is_the_difference_between_Proof_of_Work__Proof_of_Stake__and_Delegated_Proof_of_Stake">What is the difference between Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Delegated Proof of Stake?</span>

**Proof of work** - Miners solve a complex mathematical problem. The miner that solves the problem first adds the block to the blockchain. The network rewards the miner for doing so.

**Proof of stake** - Requires ownership, or stake, in the cryptocurrency. The more tokens you own, the more block creation power you have. Benefits: eliminates the need for expensive mining rigs, runs on a tiny fraction of the power, and it requires block producers to have a stake in the network.

**Delegated proof of stake** - Block-creating accounts, called witnesses, are collectively approved by Worth stakeholders. Instead of relying on proof of work to find blocks, the Worth network actively schedules these accounts to improve the time between blocks to 3 seconds.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Blockchain">^</a>
## <span id="How_often_does_the_Worth_blockchain_produce_a_new_block">How often does the Worth blockchain produce a new block?</span>

The Wortheum blockchain schedules witnesses to produce a new block every 3 seconds. 21 witness nodes produce 21 blocks in each 63-second round.

# Security

## <span id="How_can_I_keep_my_Worth_account_secure">How can I keep my Worth account secure?</span>

<b>Save your master password and keep it somewhere safe.</b>

Only log into your account using the key with the appropriate permissions for what you are doing:
- Posting key for every day logins
- Active key when necessary for transfers, power ups, etc.
- Master password or owner key when changing the password

Again, <b>save your master password</b> and keep it safe! If logging in with your post key, make sure you don't overwrite or misplace your original master password.

It is not recommended to share your password or keys with any third party site.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Security">^</a>
## <span id="Why_should_I_be_careful_with_my_master_password">Why should I be careful with my master password?</span>

The master password is used to derive all keys for your account, including the owner key. If someone has access to your master password, they can steal your account and all of the tokens in it.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Security">^</a>
## <span id="Why_is_the_master_password_a_long_string_of_gibberish">Why is the master password a long string of gibberish?</span>

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Security">^</a>
## <span id="What_are_my_different_keys_for">What are my different keys for?</span>

**Posting key** - The posting key allows accounts to post, comment, edit, vote, resteem, and follow or mute other accounts. Most users should be logging into Wortheum every day with the posting key. You are more likely to have your password or key compromised the more you use it so a limited posting key exists to restrict the damage that a compromised account key would cause.

**Active key** - The active key is meant for more sensitive tasks such as transferring funds, power up/down transactions, converting Worth Dollars, voting for witnesses, updating profile details and avatar, and placing a market order.

**Memo key** - Currently the memo key is not used.

**Owner key** - The owner key is only meant for use when necessary. It is the most powerful key because it can change any key of an account, including the owner key. Ideally it is meant to be stored offline, and only used to recover a compromised account.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Security">^</a>
## <span id="What_do_I_do_if_I_lost_my_password_keys">What do I do if I lost my password/keys?</span>

There is no way to recover your account if you lose your password or owner key! Because your account has real value, it is **very important** that you save your master password somewhere safe where you will not lose it.

It is strongly recommended that you store an offline copy of your password somewhere safe in case of a hard drive failure or other calamity. Consider digital offline storage, such as an external disk or flash drive, as well as printed paper. Use a safe deposit box for best redundancy.

# Witnesses

## <span id="What_are_Wortheum_witnesses">What are Wortheum witnesses?</span>

The Wortheum blockchain requires a set of people to create blocks and uses a consensus mechanism called delegated proof of stake, or DPOS. The community elects 'witnesses' to act as the network's block producers and governance body. There are 20 full-time witnesses, producing a block every 63-second round. A 21st position is shared by the backup witnesses, who are scheduled proportionally to the amount of stake-weighted community approval they have. Witnesses are compensated with Worth Power for each block they create.
